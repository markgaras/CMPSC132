I did not have any issues when replacing my code with the given. 

Now critically examine the code in the convertToPostfix function definition.
 What differences do you see between your function definition and this version?
 Using material from CMPSC 132, write a paragraph about the use of data structures
 in the downloaded version of project 3.

The only differences I saw was that I did my precedence with with a dictionary, and 
there were times where my if statements checked if something==something, where
the given code instead checked if something!=something and switched around the code under
the if. Essentially, the data structures built in a way that it could be replaced seamlessly
and that shows uniformaty. Other than that, the code was the same (besides variable naming and
comments of course). I also printed within the convertToPostFix instead of outside the function.
